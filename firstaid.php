    <br/><h3><b>Diarrhoea</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p ><b>Preventing diarrhoea</b>
To prevent the spread of infections that cause diarrhoea, you should always maintain high standards of hygiene.

You should:

        <Ul><li>wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after going to the toilet and before eating or preparing food .</li>
            <li>clean the toilet, including the handle and the seat, with disinfectant after each bout of diarrhoea</li>
            <li>avoid sharing towels, flannels, cutlery or utensils with others</li>
<li>wash soiled clothing and bed linen separately from other clothes and at the highest temperature possible – for example, 60C or higher for linen – after first removing any poo into the toilet 
    avoid returning to work or school until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea</li>
            <li>You or your child should also avoid swimming pools for 2 weeks after the last episode of diarrhoea.</li>
    </Ul>

    <br/><h3><b>FEVER</b></h3>
   <br/>
    <lead>Treating a fever</lead>
If your child has a fever, it's important to keep them hydrated by giving them plenty of cool water to drink.

Babies should be given plenty of liquids, such as breast milk or formula. Even if your child isn't thirsty, try to get them to drink little and often to keep their fluid levels up.

If the environment is warm, you could help to your child to stay at a comfortable temperature by covering them with a lightweight sheet or opening a window.

However, they should still be appropriately dressed for their surroundings and sponging your child with cool water isn't recommended to reduce a fever.</p>

<p >
Treating high cholesterol
If you've been diagnosed with high cholesterol, you'll be advised to make changes to your diet and increase your level of exercise.

After a few months, if your cholesterol level hasn't dropped, you may be advised to take cholesterol-lowering medication.

Changing your diet, stopping smoking and exercising more will also help to prevent high cholesterol developing.

The various treatments for high cholesterol are outlined below.
